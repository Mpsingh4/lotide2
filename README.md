# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @Mpsingh4/lotide2`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@Mpsingh4/lotide2');`

**Call it:**
`const results = _.head([1, 2, 3]) // => [1]`
`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`
`const results = _.middle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // => [3]`
## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `head`: calls the first index of an array or string
* `tail`: calls all but the first index of an array or string
* `middle`: call the middle index or middle two indexes
